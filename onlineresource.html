        <h2>Google's Sustainability Reports</h2>
        <p>An online resource I found was Google’s Sustainability Reports. This resource highlights Google’s social responsibility, and ethical initiatives because within it, anyone who uses it can see up to date articles on Google’s view/perspective on certain topics. An example of this is a report on the environment. By viewing this specific report, one can see every point on how Google will contribute to a specific environmental sustainability strategy. An example of this is Google’s Green Lights tool which was found on this report. It would be a form of AI that has the potential for up to a 30% reduction in stops at stop lights, and up to a 10% reduction in emissions at intersections.</p>
