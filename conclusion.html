    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
    <p>Overall, Google is doing a lot of good work when it comes to corporate social responsibility. Its focus on environmental sustainability, charitable donations, and employee wellness makes it stand out as a responsible company. Along with helping marginalized groups of people enter the field that they specialize in, they also create free software that anybody can use that enhances daily quality of life. These alone highlight Googleâ€™s push for a modern view on how businesses, especially in the tech industry can continue to become ethical, and socially responsible.</p>
