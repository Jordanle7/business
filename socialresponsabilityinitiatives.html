        <h2>Carbon Neutral Since 2007</h2>
        <p>Google has been carbon neutral since 2007, this is because it offsets its carbon emissions by investing in different renewable energy projects. By the year 2030, Google has stated it wants all of its data centers and offices to begin running entirely on clean energy, which will bring significant benefits for the environment. Some of these renewable energy projects include: Orsted, NextEra energy, and Apex Clean Energy. Google, as well as any other business becoming carbon neutral helps reduce alot of harmful greenhouse gas emissions, which slows down climate change and improves air quality, leading to an overall better public health. It also supports the use of renewable energy which can lead to more jobs, protects natural resources, and creates jobs in other industries, which in turn helps both the environment and society.

        <h2>Grow with Google</h2>
        <p>There is a project called “Grow with Google” which helps people learn different online skills that are important in certain jobs in the job market. Some of these skills are: certification, training, and the ability to find jobs near homes. This program is focused on helping underrepresented groups like women and minorities get the training they need and deserve to succeed in a tech related job/field, or even start their own business themselves. Giving people digital skills makes the field more accessible, which increases employability, which also helps with all kinds of economic opportunity. Focusing on underrepresented groups, job’s in the tech industry, or any job in general can be made for any type of individual.</p>
